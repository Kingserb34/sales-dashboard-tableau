# Sales & Profit Trends Dashboard (Superstore Dataset)

This Tableau project explores sales, profitability, and customer behavior trends using the fictional but widely-used **Superstore** dataset. It simulates a real-world business intelligence scenario where a company wants to understand performance across time, regions, customer segments, and product categories.

## 🔍 Key Business Questions Answered

- How have sales trended year-over-year and month-to-month?
- Which categories and sub-categories are the most profitable?
- Which regions drive the most sales and profit?
- How do different customer segments behave in terms of spending and profitability?
- Are there any products or sub-categories with high sales but low profit margins?
